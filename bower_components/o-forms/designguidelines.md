These components are used as the building blocks for creating all types of forms. These forms should be able to be used on all devices ie desktop, mobile and tablet.

## Form rules:

**Labels** - Always label the form component ie a text input, select box to help the user understand it’s meaning.

**Order the components logically** - Reflect the natural flow of a conversation. For example would you ask for someones bank details before you asked for their name?

**Group related information** - For example Personal Details, and Payment Details.

**Never need to explain** - If it’s too complicated for the user to fill out then you will need to rethink it.

**Error message** - Notify the user as soon as an error has occured. Validation message - Only valid at key points so as not to frustrate the user.

## Form layout:

**Columns** - Forms fields should only ever consist of a single column.

**Column alignment** - Mobile keep centred with minimum 5px border. Desktop and Tablet keep centred with the page. 

**Form fields** - these shouldn’t extend 400 px on Desktop and Tablet.
